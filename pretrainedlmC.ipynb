The task aims to evaluate whether a system can distinguish if a natural language statement makes sense to humans or not and provide a reason. **ConVE** includes three subtasks that require models to acquire and apply commonsense knowledge. In this notebook you will focus on **SubTask C**:\n",

        "     *Reason A*: An elephant is much bigger than a fridge.  \n",
        "     *Reason B*: A fridge is much smaller than an elephant.  \n",

        "     This subtask can be approached as a Sequence-to-Sequence problem where the input is the nonsensical statement and the output is a valid reason.\n",

The [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) allows you to explore all the models supported by **Transformers** and even share your own models with the community. In this assignment, you will work with [BART](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/bart), a pre-trained Sequence-to-Sequence model.\n",
